# Percept
The goal of this application was to try and create a task management software that would use machine learning to help people figure out when to do tasks rather than just help them keep track of them. It is currently a work in progress so it doesn't look great nor is it thatt secure, but hopefully it will be finished soon. Check out the little that exists of this project at https://percept.netlify.com/#/.
